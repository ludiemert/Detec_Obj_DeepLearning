## Prerequisites

To run this project, the following versions are required:

- TensorFlow version 2.0.0
- Keras version 2.3.1

### Key Libraries

- `os`
- `matplotlib`
- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `numpy`
- `keras` and `tensorflow` for neural network modeling and training
- `sklearn` for training and test data splitting

## Main Parameters

- `path`: Directory where the sample images are stored.
- `batch_size_val`: Number of images processed in each training batch.
- `steps_per_epoch_val`: Number of iterations per epoch.
- `epochs_val`: Number of epochs for training.
- `imageDimensions`: Dimensions of the input images (32x32, RGB).

## Image Preprocessing

Images go through the following preprocessing steps:

1. **Grayscale conversion**.
2. **Histogram equalization** for intensity standardization.
3. **Normalization** to values between 0 and 1.

## Data Augmentation

An `ImageDataGenerator` is used to create variations of training images, enhancing data diversity and improving model generalization. Augmentation includes:

- Width and height shifts.
- Zoom.
- Angle adjustments.
- Rotation.

## Model Architecture

The CNN is structured as follows:

1. **Convolutional Layers** for feature extraction.
2. **MaxPooling Layers** for dimensionality reduction.
3. **Dropout Layer** for regularization.
4. **Dense Layer** for final classification.

**Activation Function:** `ReLU` for convolutional layers and `Softmax` for the output layer.  
**Optimizer:** `Adam` with a learning rate of 0.001.

## Training

The model is trained using `fit_generator`, which utilizes the training and validation datasets. Loss and accuracy history are recorded and displayed in plots at the end of training.

## Model Evaluation and Saving

The model is evaluated on the test set, with loss and accuracy scores printed at the end. The final model is saved to the `modelo.h5` file.

## Running the Code

1. Ensure the `Images` directory contains folders with images for each class.
2. Run the script to train the model.
3. View the performance charts at the end of training.

**Note**: Training time may vary between 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the machine.
