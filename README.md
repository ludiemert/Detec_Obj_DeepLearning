## Requirements

To run this project, the following libraries and versions are recommended:

- OpenCV (for image capture and processing)
- Keras 2.3.1 and TensorFlow 2.0.0 (for neural network training)
- Numpy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (for plotting training history)

- Use the following command to install the libraries:

```python
pip install matplotlib keras==2.3.1 tensorflow==2.0.0 scikit-learn numpy opencv-python
```

---

### Project Structure

The project is organized into three main code files:

 - captura.py - Captures and saves images from the webcam.
 - treinamentoCNN.py - Processes images, builds, trains, and saves the CNN model.
 - testeModelo.py - Loads the trained model and performs real-time gesture predictions.

---

## Project Overview üöÄ

1. Image Capture (captura.py)
This script opens the webcam and captures images to build a dataset for training. Key points:

 - OpenCV: Used to access the webcam and capture frames.
 - Image Resize: Resizes images to 32x32 pixels to balance processing speed with recognition accuracy.
 - File Saving: Saves images to Imagens/1/ folder, naming them sequentially for easy management.

---

2. Model Training (treinamentoCNN.py)
This script opens the webcam and captures images to build a dataset for training. Key points:

  - This script builds and trains a CNN model to recognize hand gestures from the images collected in the previous step.

#### Libraries Used:

 - Keras for building and training the CNN model.
 - TensorFlow optimizer Adam (used to minimize loss and enhance accuracy).
 - Matplotlib for visualizing the model‚Äôs training history.
   
 #### Core Functions:

 - Image Preprocessing: Converts images to grayscale, normalizes pixel values, and equalizes histograms for consistent lighting.
 - Data Splitting: Divides data into training, validation, and test sets (80% training, 20% test).
 - Image Augmentation: Uses ImageDataGenerator to generate variations, improving generalization.

 #### Training Configuration:

 - epochs_val=10: Sets the number of training epochs.
 - batch_size_val=50: Defines batch size for training, balancing memory use and accuracy.
 - Saves the model as modelo.h5.

 ---


3. Real-Time Gesture Prediction (testeModelo.py)
This script uses the trained model to predict hand gestures in real-time.

 - OpenCV: Captures images from the webcam for prediction.
 - Model Loading: Loads the trained CNN model from modelo.h5.
 - Preprocessing: Applies the same preprocessing steps as during training (grayscale, equalization, normalization).
   
#### Prediction:
 - Assigns probability values to each gesture category.
 - Displays the gesture name and probability on the video feed.


---

## Model Details

The CNN model has the following structure:

 1 - Convolutional Layers: Two layers to extract essential features of gestures.
 - Conv2D with relu activation for non-linearity.
 - MaxPooling2D for down-sampling to reduce dimensionality.
2 - Dropout Layers: To prevent overfitting, 50% of neurons are dropped in the second layer.
3 - Flatten Layer: Transforms data to a 1D array for the dense layer.
4 - Dense Layers: Final classification using softmax activation.

---

## Notes

 - Training Time: Training takes around 20-30 minutes depending on system specs.
 - Image Dimensions: Each image is resized to 32x32 pixels for compatibility with the model.
 - Folder Structure: Ensure images are saved in the appropriate folders under Imagens/ with each folder representing a class label.
